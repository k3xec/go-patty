AX.25 is a tough protocol to use on UNIX systems. A lot of the support in
Linux, specifically, is pretty hard to use, and tends to be built into the
reptilian brain of the kernel. [xan](https://xan.link/) built a userland AX.25
stack called [patty](https://scm.xan.host/patty.git/), for which I have now
built some Go bindings on top of.
